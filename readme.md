# We-B-Scraping

I was tasked with creating a full stack Java application for my final project at the CareerDevs Computer Science Academy. While most of the implementation was left up to me to decide upon there were a few requirements that had to be met. First of which, was that the application scraped financial information from a site, such as Yahoo Finance. Once the information was obtained, it was to be put into a database of my choice, then retrieved from the database and displayed to the user.

### Technologies used in this application are as follows:

* Java 8
* Maven
* Spring MVC
* Spring Security
* Hibernate
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* MySql
* Selenium
* JSP
* Bootstrap
